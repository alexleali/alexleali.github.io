  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a student at Bowling Green State University and currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I love learning anything about technology and adapting it to solve real world problems. Prior to enrolling in BGSU, I have developed software in Java and Python to learn programming. Ever since I enrolled, I have learned even more important and diverse programing languages and software. As the industry emerges with new software, I am eager to utilize it to it's potential. </p>
